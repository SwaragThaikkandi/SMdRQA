Clearly describe the solution or enhancement you would like to see implemented in the SMdRQA package. Be specific about the functionality or feature you're requesting. For instance: "I would like to have the ability to define and use custom distance measures in SMdRQA's analysis functions."

**Describe any alternatives you've considered**
If you've explored or thought about alternative solutions or features, provide a brief description of them here. This helps in understanding the thought process behind your request. For example: "I've considered using other libraries that support custom distance measures, but integrating this functionality directly into SMdRQA would streamline my workflow."
