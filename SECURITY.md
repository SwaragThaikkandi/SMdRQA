# Security Policy

## Overview:
Our organization is committed to maintaining a secure and reliable software environment for our GitHub repository. This security policy outlines the measures, practices, and guidelines that all contributors, maintainers, and stakeholders must adhere to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our codebase and associated resources.

## Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) for Project "smdrqa"

### CPE Identifier:

```bash
cpe:2.3:a:swaragthaikkandi:smdrqa:-:*:*:*:*:python:*:*
```

### Description:
This CPE identifier (`cpe:2.3:a:swaragthaikkandi:smdrqa:-:*:*:*:*:python:*:*`) is specifically associated with this project. It denotes the version as unspecified (`-`) in this context.

### Usage Guide for Project "smdrqa":
1. **Asset Identification:**
   - Utilize this CPE to identify and document instances of the "smdrqa" software within your project's IT environment.

2. **Vulnerability Management:**
   - Use the CPE information to track vulnerabilities and security advisories related to the "smdrqa" software used in your project.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Leverage the CPE data to assess the risk associated with the "smdrqa" component in your project, considering its version and Python platform.

4. **Compliance and Best Practices:**
   - By incorporate CPE information into project's security policies and practices we ensure compliance and adherence to security best practices.

### Responsibilities:
- **Project Team:** The project team is responsible for managing and updating CPE data related to the "smdrqa" software within the project's scope.

### Update Frequency:
- Regularly review and update the CPE information as needed to reflect changes in software versions or configurations within the project.

### Additional Resources:
For more information about Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) and its usage, refer to resources such as the NIST Common Platform Enumeration website and related security standards.


## Code Quality and Security Practices:
All code contributions and modifications must adhere to the following quality and security standards:
- Compliance with coding standards, best practices, and style guidelines established by the project.
- Use of secure coding practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- Integration of automated code analysis tools like Bandit, DevSkim, CodeQL, StackHawk's HawkScan, Trufflehog OSS, and OSSAR into the development workflow to detect and address security issues promptly.
- Conducting peer code reviews to ensure code quality, security, and adherence to established guidelines before merging changes into the main branch.

## Dependency Management:
Managing dependencies responsibly is crucial for maintaining a secure codebase. The following practices should be followed:
- Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- Utilize dependency scanning tools like Synk - Package Health to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- Review and validate the licensing, compatibility, and security posture of dependencies before integration into the project.

## Security Monitoring and Incident Response:
Continuous monitoring and proactive response to security incidents are integral to our security posture. Key practices include:
- Implementation of GitHub Code Scanning (CodeQL) for automated security analysis and monitoring of codebase vulnerabilities.
- Enablement of GitHub Actions for security workflows such as code scanning, dependency reviews, and security analysis.
- Prompt reporting and mitigation of security incidents or vulnerabilities discovered in the repository.

## Workflows and Security Issues Addressed:
### 1. Code Analysis Workflow:
- Uses automated code analysis tools (e.g., Bandit) to identify security vulnerabilities and code quality issues in Python code.
- Addresses issues such as insecure coding practices, common vulnerabilities in Python code, and adherence to secure coding standards.

### 2. Dependency Scanning Workflow:
- Utilizes dependency scanning tools (e.g., Synk - Package Health) to detect vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and manage dependencies securely.
- Addresses issues related to outdated or vulnerable dependencies, licensing, and compatibility risks.

### 3. CodeQL Workflow:
- Implements GitHub Code Scanning with CodeQL for advanced static analysis and security testing of the codebase.
- Addresses complex security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and potential threats using CodeQL's powerful analysis capabilities.

### 4. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Workflow (StackHawk's HawkScan):
- Integrates dynamic application security testing to identify and address security vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Addresses issues such as OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and potential attack vectors.

### 5. Trufflehog OSS Workflow:
- Conducts security scanning to detect sensitive information leaks and potential security risks in the repository.
- Addresses issues related to sensitive data exposure, secrets leakage, and risk assessment of codebase security.

### 6. OSSAR Workflow:
- Utilizes OSSAR (Open Source Security Analysis Report) for automated security analysis on the open-source components of the project.
- Addresses potential security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and best practices violations within the open-source codebase.

## Reporting Security Concerns:
Any individual who identifies or suspects a security vulnerability, breach, or policy violation must report it immediately through established channels, such as:
- Direct communication with project maintainers or security contacts.
- Utilization of issue tracking systems or security incident reporting mechanisms provided by the organization.
- Reporting to relevant security response teams or platforms as per the project's guidelines.

## Policy Review and Updates:
This security policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure its relevance, effectiveness, and alignment with evolving security threats and best practices. Updates or revisions to the policy will be communicated to all relevant parties, and adherence to the updated policy will be enforced accordingly.

## Conclusion:
By following this security policy and embracing a culture of security awareness and best practices, we aim to create a resilient and secure GitHub repository that fosters trust, collaboration, and innovation while safeguarding our assets and data against potential threats and vulnerabilities.
